_Remote Code Execution as a Service_

A system for secure and high-performance execution of arbitrary code, powered by [Firecracker microVMs](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker).

## Getting Started

Before you do anything, you'll need:
- [a Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/)
    - As well as your native toolchain, you'll need to `rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- A few system packages:
    - Ubuntu: `apt install curl git build-essential ca-certificates gnupg`

Clone down the repo and init submodules:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Joeyh021/pyromaniac.git
cd pyromaniac
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Firecracker comes with a dev container to make life easier. Use it to check that your machine and environment supports virtualisation and other necessary features for Firecracker:

```sh
sudo firecracker/tools/devtool checkenv  # sudo is not needed if you have access to dmesg
```

Pyromaniac looks for the VM resources in a `resources` directory. Put the firecracker binary there, either download the [latest release from Github](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases/latest), or compile your own copy:

```sh
firecracker/tools/devtool build --release
cp firecracker/build/cargo_target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/firecracker ./resources
# also copy jailer (see below)
cp firecracker/build/cargo_target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/jailer ./resources 
```

### Kernel

Specific kernel configs are required to include the device drivers needed for firecracker. The easiest thing to do is to build in Firecracker's devcontainer using their provided configs. Build and copy into the `resources` directory:

```sh
firecracker/tools/devtool build_kernel -c resources/guest_configs/microvm-kernel-x86_64-5.10.config -n $(nproc)
cp firecracker/build/kernel/linux-5.10/vmlinux-5.10-x86_64.bin ./resources/kernel.bin
```

### RootFS

Different images are used for different languages, and are built using `scripts/mkrootfs <language>`:

```
scripts/mkrootfs.sh python
scripts/mkrootfs.sh rust
scripts/mkrootfs.sh java
```

This will
1. Build `pyrod` 
    - `pyrod` is built for `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, you'll have to install that target via rustup
2. Create a new ext4 image file and mount it
3. Build an alpine-based Docker container and copy it's root filesystem into the mounted image file
4. Unmount the image file and copy it into the resources directory

### Starting the Server

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure it with your desired port, and the **full path** to the resource directory.

```
cargo run --bin=pyromaniac
```

This will launch the server on the given port. For other config options for the server, such as configuring the firecracker runtime options see `pyromaniac/src/config.rs`. When running in debug mode, jailer is not used, and the console output from the VM is written to `vm.out`.

The server exposes a single endpoint, `/api/run`, which accepts JSON with the following schema:

```json
{
    "lang": "Python",
    "code": "print(f\"Hello, {input()}!\")",
    "input": "joeyh021"
}
```

The response will look like:

```json
{
    "stdout": "Hello, joeyh021",
    "stderr": "",
}
```

## Deployment in Production

You'll need a firecracker binary and kernel and rootfs as before, but you'll also need a jailer binary, and to take a few extra steps to secure the machine you're running on. A jailer binary can be built the same as firecracker (details above), and can be found at `firecracker/build/cargo_target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release`. Place this next to the firecracker binary.

For jailer to run securely, it needs a dedicated system user with no privileges to that the firecracker process will run as:

```
sudo useradd --system --shell /bin/false firecracker
```

The server will by default use jailer instead of just firecracker when compiled with `--release`. Jailer uses certain kernel features to drop privileges for the firecracker binary, which requires that jailer run as root. 

Add the required config settings to the `.env` file:
```sh
echo "RESOURCE_PATH=$(pwd)/resources" >> .env  # resource path needs to be the full path
echo "UID=$(id -u firecracker)" >> .env
echo "GID=$(id -g firecracker)" >> .env
echo "PORT=8000" >> .env  
```

Start the server with

```sh
cargo build --release --bin=pyromaniac 
sudo target/release/pyromaniac
```

While running the server as root is not ideal, this does not affect the security of firecracker or jailer's sandboxing. See [this issue](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/issues/1190) for further discussion.

##Â Development

### Adding a new language

Currently supported languages:
- Python
- Rust
- Java
- BASH (Bourne Again SHell)
- Sh (/bin/ash)

See [here](docs/languages.md) for full info on the details of each supported language.

To add a new one:
- Add a new implemenation of the `Runner` trait in `pyrod/src/run`
    - `Runner::compile` should write the code out to a file, and then run the compiler if necessary
    - `Runner::run` should execute the compiled file
- Add it to the `Language` enum (and it's `impl`s) in `pyrod/src/run/mod.rs`
- Add a new rootfs build for it by creating a new Dockerfile in `scripts/images`
- Add it as an option in `scripts/mkrootfs.sh`
- Add it to docs/languages.md
